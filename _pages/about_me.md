## Experiences

### <span style="text-decoration: underline">[**Sefy**](https://apps.apple.com/gb/app/sefy/id1596826300){:target="_blank"}</span>
*Sefy LTD* <span style="color:green">*(Aug 2022 - Present)*</span>

* Increased the efficiency of data aggregation **by 1000%** by automating it with **Python Scripts** on AWS EC2 Crontab.
* Improved the inefficiency of Many-to-many relationships in **DynamoDB** by tuning the structure and customising the **GraphQL** resolvers.
* Accomplished Separation of Concerns by not only managing the global states with **React Context** but also using **Custom Hooks** when developing an Admin Dashboard with React, which boosted the performance of collaboration, as well as <span style="text-decoration: underline">[**React Web App**](https://undertone.sefy.io/){:target="_blank"}</span>.

### <span style="text-decoration: underline">[**Themeparkers**](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.kgeun.themeparkers){:target="_blank"}</span>
*Joy Crafters* <span style="color:green">*(Mar 2022 - Present)*</span>

* Designed and implemented the architecture of the Back End of a mobile application. Developed Client API and Batch Server using **Django REST Framework**.
* Experienced in designing and deploying an AWS solution including **EC2**, **S3**, **EBS**, **ELB**, and **Auto Scaling Groups**. Worked at optimising volumes, and EC2 instances, and separated private and public servers with **VPC**.
* Used **Jenkins** with scripts to automate the build and the deployment process, which **reduced human error** and **sped up production processes**. **Increased** the number of downloads **by 50%** thanks to CI/CD.
   
### **Research Assistant**   
*King's College London* <span style="color:green">*(Aug 2021 - Sep 2021)*</span>

* The research was about defining the behaviours of abused 3rd party cookies over the websites and simulating them on Graph Transformation (a.k.a. Graph Rewriting) Tool - PORGY.
* Studied the background - **OSI Model**, **TCP/IP Model**, **HTTP**, **Cookies**, **Graph Morphism**; and utilised them to build the model - "A Graph-Based Model of the Cookie-Management Process in Web-Browsers".
* Created new rules to define the 3rd-Party Cookies behaviours and analysed the performance of opting out services, such as Privacy Badger by simulating the model.

## Side Projects
**E-Commerce Web Design Project**   
* Improved the Readability and followed Object-Oriented-Programming principles by using **Django ORM**.
* Built a CI/CD pipeline with **Jenkins**, which automatically fetches the code from GitHub, tests (Sonarqube), sends notifications (Slack) and delivers (Docker) that helps developers **update the code flawlessly**.
* Maximised the Flexibility of deployment by containerising the app and dependencies with **Docker** and **Docker-Compose**.

## Education

**King's College London, United Kingdom**
