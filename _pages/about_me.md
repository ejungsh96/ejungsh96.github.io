# Seokhwan Jung

DevOps Engineer, Photographer, Runner.  
<br>
A diligent and highly motivated BSc Computer Science graduate with a concrete foundation in **Data Structures**, **Optimisation**, and **Operating Systems**. Have experience in developing API Servers with **Django** and **AWS**. Eager to absorb as much knowledge and skills as possible in the area of a fast and stable **CI/CD** oriented **DevOps** culture.

## Currently

Looking for a job as a **DevOps Engineer** / **Backend Engineer**.

### Specialized in

>- Python
>- Django
>- Java
>- Linux
>- AWS
>- Ansible
>- Jenkins
>- Docker
>- Kubernetes
>- Terraform

### Research interests

Building a cloud-based, highly integrated CI/CD pipeline.

## Experiences

### [**Themeparkers**](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.kgeun.themeparkers) 
*Joy Crafters* <span style="color:green">*(Mar 2022 - Present)*</span>

* Designed and implemented the architecture of the backend of the mobile application. Developing Client API and Batch Server using **Django REST Framework**.
* Experienced in designing and deploying AWS solutions using **EC2**, **S3**, **EBS**, **ELB**, and **Auto Scaling groups**. Worked at optimising volumes, and EC2 instances, and created multiple **VPC** instances.
* Used **Jenkins** with scripts to automate build and deployment that **reduced human error** and **sped up production processes**.
* **Increased** the number of downloads **by 50%** as a consequence of building a **CI/CD pipeline** that sped up the delivery process.
   
### **Research Assistant**   
*King's College London* <span style="color:green">*(Aug 2021 - Sep 2021)*</span>

* The research was about defining the behaviours of abused 3rd party cookies over the websites and simulating them on Graph Transformation (a.k.a. Graph Rewriting) Tool - PORGY.
* Studied the background - **OSI Model**, **TCP/IP Model**, **HTTP**, **Cookies**, **Graph Morphism**; and utilised them to build the model - "A Graph-Based Model of the Cookie-Management Process in Web-Browsers".
* Created new rules to define the 3rd-Party Cookies behaviours and analysed the performance of opting out services, such as Privacy Badger by simulating the model.

## Side Projects
**E-Commerce Web Design Project**   
*Server Development - Django, AWS*  
* Built a backend of an E-Commerce Website using Django.
* Stored static files and images in an S3 bucket that **reduced unnecessary load** on the server. Used **Django ORM** for DB and connected it to **RDS**. Deployed the application with **Nginx** in EC2.

*CI/CD - Jenkins, Sonarqube, Docker*  
* Used Jenkins to build a CI/CD pipeline which automatically fetches the code from GitHub, tests (Sonarqube), sends notifications (Slack) and delivers (Docker) that helps developers **update the code flawlessly**.
* Kept the application **portable** and **flexible** by containerising it.
