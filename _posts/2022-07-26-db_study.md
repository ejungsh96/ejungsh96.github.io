## What is a Database?

According to Oracle - one of the biggest DB companies -  a database is defined as:

>*"A database is an **organised collection of structured information, or data**, typically stored electronically in a computer system."*  

It is managed with a **database management system (DBMS)** such as *MySQL*, *PostgreSQL*, *MongoDB* and *Amazon DynamoDB*. Here, MySQL and PostgreSQL is a relational database (RDB) while MongoDB and Amazon DynamoDB is a Non SQL (NoSQL) (a.k.a. Not only SQL).

## RDB

>*Oracle, MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite, MariaDB, Microsoft SQL Server*

* The most widely used approach for managing data.
* Data is organised into tables - *relations*.
* Typically employ *Structured Query Language (SQL)*.

### Limitations
* Difficult to scale horizontally (Scale out).
   * Because it is designed to ensure *consistency*.
* Difficult to manage unstructured data - such as email messages, photos, videos, etc.
  * Because it is designed to manage structured data, or data that aligns with a predefined data type.


## NoSQL

* Designed to maximise availability at the expense of consistency.
  * Aims for *eventual consistency*.
  * Reads an earlier version of it instead of receiving an error whereas RDB returns an error.

### Document based DB
>*MongoDB, Couchbase, Apache, CouchDB*   

* Stores data in the form of decuments.
  * Similar to Key-Value Store - each document has a unique identifier (key).
  * The difference is that Document based DB cares the type of data (*Metadata*) it stores, whereas Key Value based DB treats the data as *opaque* - it's up to the application.
  * Data and Metadata are stored hierachically in JSON-based documents inside the database.
* Stores all the data of a given object in a single document.
  * As JSON, BSON, XML, or YAML documents.
* **Highly scalable**, with sharding being a common horizontal scaling strategy.
* Excellent for keeping large amounts of unrelated, complex information that varies in strucutre.
  * Use cases: *E-Commerce*, *Blogging*, *Analytics Platforms*, and *Content Management Systems*.

### Key Value DB
>*Redis, Memcached, Amazon DynamoDB, Riak*   

* Storing and managing associative arrays - a.k.a. *a dictionary or hash table*.
  * Values can be from integers or strings, to JSON structures.
* Stores data as a single collection without any strucuture or relation.
* Treats any data as an opaque blob; it's up to the application to understand how it's structured.
* **Highly performant**, **efficient**, and **scalable**.
  * Use cases: *Caching*, *Message Queuing*, and *Session Management*.

### Column based DB
>*Apach, Cassandra, Apache HBase, ClickHouse*   

* Stores data in columns.
  * Each column is stored in a separate file or region in the system's storage.  
* Appears in record order.
  * The first entry in one column is related to the first entry in other columns.
* Pros - Good where an application needs to frequently perform **aggregate functions**.
  * Such as finding the average or sum total of data in a column.
* Cons - The *load performance* tends to be **slow**.
  * Because each column must be written separately and data is often kept compressed.

### Graph based DB
>*Neo4j, ArangoDB, OrientDB*   

* Subcategory of the Document based DB but the graph databases add an extra layer to the Document based DB by highlighting the relationships between individual documents.
* Concepts:
  * Node - Individual entity.
  * Property - Relevant information related to individual nodes.
  * Edge (a.k.a. Graph or Relationship) - Representation of how two nodes are related.
    * Undirected - shows a connection between nodes.
    * Directed - when edges have different meanings depending on where the direction is originated.

## Table of Comparison Between RDB and NoSQL

|                     | RDB                          | NoSQL                                      |
|---------------------|------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| Data                | Structured Data              | Unstructured Data                          |
| Big Data Processing | Performance decreased        | Applicable                                 |
| Schema              | Structured Schema exists     | Either there's no Schema or easily changed |
| Transaction         | Consistent with transaction  | No transaction                             |
| Search              | Complex one such as JOIN etc.| Simple search provided                     |
| Scalability         | Not good for cluster         | Good for cluster                           |
| Lisence             | Might be expensive           | Open Source                                |
| Services            | Oracle, MySQL, PostgreSQL    | Cassandra, MongoDB, Amazon DynamoDB        |


## Selection Criteria

* Operation and maintenance costs
* Service stability
